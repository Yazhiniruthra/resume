            <h3><strong>PROJECTS</strong></h3>
            <p><em><strong>Fruit harvesting farmbot</strong></em></p>
            <p>The agricultural industry has many problems, including the decrease
                number of farm workers and increasing cost of fruit harvesting. As the younger
                generations migrate to urban areas, the pickers are aging and global shortage of
                seasonal fruit pickers is worsening. So, our objective is to create an automated
                system for harvesting using neural network and machine learning algorithms
                which can be used as a helping aid for our farmers.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Pridection of Chronic Kidney Disease</strong></em></p>
            <p>The proposed system predicts the CKD with minimal feature input instead of
                dumping all the features which may not relevant to predict the disease. To achieve
                minimal input selection the three features selection algorithm with combination
                of two feature extraction algorithm is used as an approach to select the best
                combination. After performing feature selection and Feature Extraction, those
                features will be trained with different Machine Learning algorithm. The accuracy
                of best combination algorithm will be implemented for predicting the CKD.
                Finally, Random Forest algorithm is chosen to implement CKDPS as it gives 95%
                accuracy, precision and recall results.</p>
